    - NOTES -

    Client-side form validation
    Define: initial check, the user can fix it straight away, should not be considered an exhaustive security measure

    Form-validation: feedback when you don't enter your data in the format they are expecting
    Browser: Validation done in the browser, client-side validation
    Server: done on the server, server-side validation

    Three reasons for validating: 
    1. We want to get the right data, in the right format
    2. We want to protect our users' data
    3. We want to protect ourselves

    !!! Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your !!! form is validating correctly and preventing malformed input on the !!! client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network request. 

    Built-in form validation:
    - required, minlength, maxlength, min, max, type, pattern, etc.
    - this can determine if an element is valid or invalid; if it's valid, it qualifies for the :valid CSS pseudo-class. If it's invalid, it can qualify for the :invalid CSS pseudo-class. 

    Regular Expression (use pattern on client-side)
    - match character combinations in text strings
    ex: a - Matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on)
    - abc, ab?c, ab*c, a|b, abc|xyz
    !!! <textarea> doesn't support pattern
    
    Validating forms using JavaScript
    - use to control look and feel of error messages

    Constraint Validation API
    - a set of methods and properties for HTMLButtonElement, HTMLFieldSetElement, HTMLInputElement, etc. : DOM interfaces avails
    - uses properties like validationMessage, validity, patternMismatch, etc.
    
    novalidate - turn off the browser's automatic validation

    Fetch API
    - JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses
    - easily used by other technologies such as Service Workers 
    - define other HTTP-related concepts such as CORS and extensions to HTTP
    - won't reject on HTTP error status, it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing
    - must include credentials option in order to set and send cookies
    ex: fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data));
    - use json() method to return json body content
