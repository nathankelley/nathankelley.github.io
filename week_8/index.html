    - NOTES -

  Transforms: 
  - translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page
  - one or more transform functions (separated by spaces)

  Translation:
  - allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down, similar to position:relative
  - translate(x,y) moves an element x from the left, and y from the top
  - use the translatex or translatey to move vertically or horizontally
  - you shouldn’t declare a new transform: because of the cascade, a second transform would override the first.
  
  Scaling:
  - scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically
  - scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on
  Rotate:
  - rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value
  - point of origin is the element’s center

  Skew:
  - skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes
  -  If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis

  Change Transform Origin:
  - you can control the origin from which your transforms are applied

  *** Choose ordering carefully! Tranformations can change if ordered differently because origin changes!


  Transitions:
  - Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time

  1. Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.
  2. Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.
  3. Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.

  Duration:
  - transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take
  - seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms)
  
  Timing:
  - transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.
  - ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out

  Delay:
  -  introduce a delay before the transition begins
  - might be a bad user experience if the user accidentally mouses through our ad on the way from one part of the document to the next
  
  Shorthand Transition
  - transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;

  Canvas, SVG, Drag, Drop

  Canvas:
  - we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript
  - avoiding the need to download images off the network
  - shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns
  Coordinate System > top-left corner is (0,0)
                    > the bottom-right corner is (200,200)
  
  Anonymous Functions: regular functions without names
  
  SVG:
  - Scalable Vector Graphics
  - vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down
  - XML: XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language

  Canvas VS SVG:
  - which is the right one to use? 
  - it depends on what you’re doing
  - Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, SVG is accessible via the DOM

  Drag and Drop API:
  - allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page
  - Draggable is not BOOLEAN!!! Must be set to true
