<!--
    - NOTES -
    Forms:
    
    > search example - (below) "action attribute is the URL that the form will be submitted to so it can be processed on the server side"

    > const form = document.forms[0] is the same as 
    const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0] - both of these are using an index

    > instead of using and index to get form data, you can use the name attribute from the form: const form = document.forms.search <- search
        - be careful though with name attribute! Built in properties or methods could interfere with the name if they're the same
        - use square bracket notation to avoid this: document.forms['search']

    > form object also has 'elements' method, returns collection of html form elements (input, button, etc.)

    > submit - use button or type='submit' on input element (even use image),
                form.submit() will do this as well

    > reset - avoid using reset, too many issues

    > form.action - can be used to set action attribute to url
        - to learn more about event.preventDefault(): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault
        - event.preventDefault() stops form from being submitted altogether
    
    Form Events (addEventListener)
    focus - element is focused on, cursor is inside element by click or tap
    blur - focus is moved away
    change - change value inside input box
