    Debugging

    Error Objects: created to handle exceptions that occur, some built-in
    RangeError - number outside of range of values
    ReferenceError - reference to an item doesn't exist
    SyntaxError - speaks for itself
    TypeError - data type issue somewhere
    URIError - problem with encoding or decoding the URI(What does that mean?)
    InternalError - error in JavaScript engine, could be too much recursion

    - errors (including these) can be used to create custom error objects
    - All of these have properties
        ErrorType(name, message, stack)
        > name will return name of error constructor as a string
        > message returns a description of the error, provided as argument
        > stack will return a stack trace

    Throw: use to throw errors, you can make custom but preferable to use built-in error functions which can be caught in a 'catch' block

    ex: throw new Error('Something has gone badly wrong!');

    Finally: added after catch block, will run no matter what (maybe you want code to run whether an error is thrown or not)

    Testing
    - often overlooked; "good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on."
    
    Test-driven Development (TDD)
    1. Write tests (that initially fail)
    2. Write code to pass the tests
    3. Refactor the code
    4. Test refactored code
    5. Write more tests for new features
    - Follow this process in small chunks. 
    - considered best practice, but sometimes hard to implement
    - do it, but don't worry about it if your tests or implementation isn't what you expect it to be

    Jest
    - TDD framework created by Facebook (downloaded)

                    Coke is the bomb.com. I just can't live without it. Mt. Dew is a pretty close second though. I think it'd do in a pinch. Also it's no coincidence that 'Pepsi' and 'blasphemy' rhyme.
