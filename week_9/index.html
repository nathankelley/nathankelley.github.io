    - NOTES -

    The Window Object
    - In a browser environment the global object is the window object

    Browser Object Model
    -  a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen
    - no official standard for the BOM
    
    Global Variables
    - can be accessed in all parts of the program
    - In a browser environment, the global object is the window object

    Dialogs
    - alert(), confirm() and prompt()

    window.alert(): will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box

    window.confirm(): will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument

    window.prompt(): will stop the execution of the program

    navigator: returns a reference to the Navigator object.  The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used

    window.location: an object that contains information about the URL of the current page
    - href property returns the full URL as a string
    - protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used
    - host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number 
    - hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL
    - port property returns a string describing the port number
    - pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain
    - search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters
    - hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier
    - origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from
    
    window.history: can be used to access information about any previously visited pages
    - .length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page
    - .go() method can be used to go to a specific page
    - .forward() and .back() methods that can be used to navigate forwards and backwards by one page

    window.open(): new window can be opened (.close, .moveTo, .resizeTo, etc.)
    window.screen: contains information about the screen (height, width, availHeight, availWidth, colorDepth )

    Document:
    document.write(): writes a string of text to the page.

    Cookies: small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer.
    - can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience and more
    Create, Change, Read, etc.: with document.cookie
    
    Timing Functions
    
    setTimeout(): accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter (.clearTimeout)

    setInterval(): it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds(.clearInterval())

    this: binding of this is set to the window object, it can get some unexpected results

    Animation
    - setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements
    
    requestAnimationFrame: making the most of the browser’s built-in graphics-handling capabilities, and not running the animation when the tab is inactive, resulting in a much smoother performance (cancelAnimationFrame)

    HTML5 API's
    - separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different paces
    data-: a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes
        ex: data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'
            data-rating = '5' 
    
    Web Storage - Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies, fewer restrictions, more storage capacity
    !!!!! Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.
    !!!!! Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies

    Geolocation - Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device
        ex: navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);

    Web Workers - allow processes to be run in the background, 
                - use the Worker() constructor function to create a new worker
                - const worker = new Worker('task.js');
                -
